Hi, I am learning devops with aws
New customers get up to $200 in credits
New AWS customers can get started at no cost with the AWS Free Tier. 
Gain $100 USD credits at sign-up and up to $100 USD more to earn as you explore key AWS services. 
Test drive AWS services with the Free Plan for up to 6 months. 
You won't be charged unless you choose the Paid Plan, which allows you to scale your operations and gain access to over 150 AWS services.
